============
Development
============

If you wish to hack the GnuCOBOL source code, proceed as follows. The
following extra packages need to be installed with versions equal or greater.

If you build from VCS the tools in the first 4 lists are always needed.

For running "autogen.sh" (necessary after VCS checkout) / reconfigure:
  o autoconf 2.64
  o automake 1.10.1
  o libtool 2.2.6
  o m4 1.4.12

If you modify top-level configure.ac or Makefile.am in any directory then
you will need to run "autoreconf -I m4" to regenerate the necessary files.

If you want to update to a newer automake/libtool version or get errors
about wrong version numbers in m4 run "autoreconf -vfi -I m4" instead.

For compiling (when changing flex/bison sources):
  o Bison 2.3     (will be changed to 3.x after release of GnuCOBOL 3.1)
  o Flex 2.5.35

For generating the testsuite (when changing any .at files):
  o autoconf 2.64

For generating the translation files (when changing any msgid):
  o gettext 0.17
    ** NOTE **
    If you don't need an up-to-date translation you can do
    "touch po/*.pot po/*.po po/*.gmo" instead.

For generating the documentation (necessary for preparing a distribution):
  o help2man 0.17
    ** NOTE **
    If you don't need an up-to-date manpage you can do
    "touch cobc/cobc.1 bin/cobcrun.1" instead.
  o texinfo 6.1 (with texinfo-tex)
  o texlive (latest, texlive-collection-latex suffices)
    ** NOTE **
    If you don't need an up-to-date info source / manual you can do
    "touch doc/gnucobol.info doc/gnucobol.pdf" instead.

For preparing a distribution do the following steps:
  ./configure           # check that the current environment is ok and
                        # generate Makefiles for distclean
  make distclean        # only needed if it isn't a direct VCS checkout
                        # --> start with a clean directory
  ./configure && make   # build, needed for re-generating bison/flex sources
                        # and for generating the texi-includes later
  po/update_linguas.sh  # get latest translations
  make distcheck        # generate a distribution tarball and check
                        # that it will work in a VPATH environment
                        # including make targets uninstall, distclean and dist
